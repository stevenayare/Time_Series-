COVID-19 Mortality Rates Time Series Analysis
Welcome to the COVID-19 Mortality Rates Time Series Analysis project repository! This project focuses on analyzing time series data related to COVID-19 mortality rates using autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and vector autoregression (VAR) models. The goal is to understand the temporal patterns of mortality rates and make predictions to aid in healthcare resource allocation and policy decisions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted public health systems worldwide, leading to a surge in demand for data-driven insights to combat the spread of the virus and mitigate its effects. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 mortality rates through time series analysis techniques, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers.
Project Overview
This project consists of the following key components:

Data Collection: Gathering time series data on COVID-19 mortality rates from reliable sources such as government health agencies, research institutes, and public databases.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the temporal patterns, trends, and correlations present in the mortality rate time series data. This includes generating Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots.
Modeling: Implementing autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and vector autoregression (VAR) models to capture the temporal dependencies and dynamics of COVID-19 mortality rates.
Evaluation and Prediction: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and making predictions of future mortality rates based on the trained models.
Visualization: Visualizing the results, including time series plots, forecasts, ACF/PACF plots, and performance metrics, to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.

Project Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:
